# About Project

Generating unique stimulus videos for pigeons.

You can use either the `pygeon.py` file from the terminal *or* the jupyter notebook. I would recommend using the notebook for editing parameters and such, but if satisfied with existing parameters or expanding features, you might want to use the og-python file.
