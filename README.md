# About Project

Generating unique stimulus videos for pigeons.

You can use either the `pygeon.py` file from the terminal *or* the jupyter notebook. I would recommend using the notebook for editing parameters and such, but if satisfied with existing parameters or expanding features, you might want to use the og-python file.


## Installation

Currently, the project has only been implemented with macOS.

### Dependencies

1. Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)
2. Clone pygeon repo
3. From Anaconda Navigator select **import**
    - All required packages will be installed.
    - This may take a while, since this environment is set up to run other CV software.


```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
